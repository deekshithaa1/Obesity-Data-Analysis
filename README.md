 🧪 Obesity Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding the factors influencing obesity.
The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, where the dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized to draw meaningful insights.
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncover potential insights related to obesity trends, patterns, and influencing factors.

  📊 Dataset Overview

  Features Include:  
  - Gender  
  - Age  
  - Height and Weight  
  - Eating habits (e.g., frequency of meals, high-calorie food consumption)  
  - Physical activity  
  - Smoking and alcohol consumption  
  - Family history of obesity  
  - Obesity classification (target variable)


 🧼 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The data was loaded using `pandas` and underwent several preprocessing steps:
- Handled missing or null values.
- Renamed columns for better readability.
- Converted categorical variables into usable formats (e.g., label encoding).
- Checked for data imbalance and outliers.

 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore patterns and trends:
- Visualized distributions of numerical features.
- Used bar plots and pie charts for categorical features.
- Created scatterplots and violin plots to understand feature interactions.
- Correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between variables.


🔍 Key Insights

- Physical activity and age had strong correlations with obesity levels.  
- Gender-specific trends were observed in obesity classification.  
- Unhealthy eating habits (e.g., frequent consumption of high-calorie food) increased obesity risk.  
- Individuals with a family history of obesity were more likely to fall into higher obesity categories.


 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language:Python 3  
- Libraries: 
  - pandas, numpy – data manipulation  
  - matplotlib, seaborn – visualizations  
  - sklearn (planned for future modeling)
